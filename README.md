# Safety_in_Dorm_System
Safety in Dorm System is the project for increase security in the dormitory using OpenCV and Webcam.

This Project use the Python language and OpenCV library to make the Face Recognition using LBPHFace recognizer.

I use Python 2.7.16 , CV2 4.2.0 , numpy 1.16.6

So, If you want to use it in real life you should install and run it on Raspberry Pi or other Single board computer whatever you want.
